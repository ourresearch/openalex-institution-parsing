### All Model Development Files
* 001 - data pull from DB and get final training data that will be used in the modeling process (PySpark/Databricks notebook)
* 002a - code that takes the data from the 001 notebook, processes the data, and trains a basic neural network model
* 002b - code that takes the data from the 001 notebook, processes the data, and fine-tunes a HuggingFace model
* 003 - running gold datasets through the model to get predictions
